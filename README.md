# A&E Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on the analysis of NHS Accident and Emergency (A&E) data to assess the performance of hospital trusts across England. By examining patient attendances, waiting times, and key performance indicators, we aim to gain insights into the efficiency and capacity of emergency departments, and identify patterns in service delivery.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The analysis targets several key areas:

- **A&E Attendances**: Analyzing attendances across different types of departments (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3).
- **Emergency Admissions**: Breakdown of emergency admissions by department type (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, etc.).
- **Performance Indicators**: Key metrics include the percentage of patients treated within 4 hours and the number of patients waiting over 12 hours from decision to admit to actual admission.
- **Trends and Insights**: We analyze trends such as seasonal variations, resource constraints, and the impact of external factors like COVID-19 on emergency care delivery.

## ðŸ“‚ Data Sources

The data for this project was sourced from [NHS England](https://www.england.nhs.uk/) and includes publicly available datasets with detailed records on A&E services.
